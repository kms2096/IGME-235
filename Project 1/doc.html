    <h2>Index.html</h2>
    <p>I kept the same overall layout with the exception of moving the subheader next to the page title. I also removed the stamp at the bottom since I did not think it would add anything to the new page. I also added a new picture and changed the colors on the page. In place of the stamp, I added a button that takes you back to the top of the page when clicked. I was also able to successfully transfer over the layout to a mobile-friendly version, without sacrificing any of the content.<br><br>While there were things I had trouble with, I would not necessarily say that they required a lot of effort. I think that making the spec 1 page had more issues because I changed the look of the page but not the layout. The only thing that I had slight issues with was the navigation. I was not quite sure what I was supposed to be doing for it since there was not much I could have it navigate to. Given this, I essentially made a navbar option that lets the user go to the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h2>Goals:</h2>
    <p>The current goal with this webpage is to have a new page layout for showcasing games I have made to recruiters.</p>

    <h2>Audience:</h2>
    <p>My current audience is recruiters looking through previous game I have worked on or made. This caused me to pick a design that has more text than pictures to explain the development behind the game.</p>

    <h2>Other:</h2>
    <p>I was able to get the bottom left text to look like a sticky note and was able to give the bottom picture to look almost like it was placed onto the picture. The last thing that I think was above and beyond was getting the metalic background behind the page title in the upper left corner.

    I was unable to get a perfect match for the subheader font, but the one I found was similar enough to me. I was also having trouble with adding things like header, main, and footer tags where they would completely ruin my layout so I decided to opt out on most of them.
