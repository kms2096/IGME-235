    <p>I am a Game Design and Development major at RIT, minoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing. I like following through 
        and taking ideas and developing them into full-fledged games and find satisfaction in solving problems and learning how things 
        work. Growing up with the Nintendo Wii, DS, and Original Xbox, I loved video games from a young age. However, I first became 
        interested in the development of video games while on a college break. During this I played two games that changed my perspective 
        from escapist fun to a form of art. Soon after, I submitted my application to RIT for Game Design and Development and 
        found a love for programming and creating experiences for other people to enjoy. Through this class and my major, I hope to get 
        closer to my goal of working in a game studio focused on single player experiences.</p>
